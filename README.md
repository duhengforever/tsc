## Voting

In various situations the OpenMessaging TSC shall hold a vote. These votes can happen on the phone, email, or via a voting service, when appropriate. TOC members can either respond "agree, yes, +1", "disagree, no, -1", or "abstain". A vote passes with two-thirds vote of votes cast based on the charter (see 6(c)(viii)). An abstain vote equals not voting at all.
